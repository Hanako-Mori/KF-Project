# KF-Project

# Notes

The `package.json` is modfied from this [template](https://github.com/HazimAr/Nextjs-ChakraUI-Boilerplate/blob/main/package.json).

I removed packages with paywalled features, i.e. [ChakraUI](https://pro.chakra-ui.com/pricing) and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/pricing/). Also, yes I know Vercel has some kind of paid [team plan](https://vercel.com/pricing) for hosting, but Next.js itself does not have any paywalled features as far as I'm aware.

# Current task(s)

## How would we scrape a webpage (for images) using Next.js?

I'll follow along [Create a public API by web scraping in NextJS ](https://dev.to/mtliendo/create-a-public-api-by-web-scraping-in-nextjs-2f5n) by [Michael Liendo](https://dev.to/mtliendo) for now. (Also thanks [dev.to](https://dev.to/) for not paywalling your articles like, e.g. Medium.)

Can't get above example to work. Time to free-style
