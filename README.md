# KF-Project

# Notes

The `package.json` is modfied from this [template](https://github.com/HazimAr/Nextjs-ChakraUI-Boilerplate/blob/main/package.json).

I removed packages with paywalled features, i.e. [ChakraUI](https://pro.chakra-ui.com/pricing) and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/pricing/). Also, yes I know Vercel has some kind of paid [team plan](https://vercel.com/pricing) for hosting, but Next.js itself does not have any paywalled features as far as I'm aware.
